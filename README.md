# Computer-Graphics-Renderer
This project documents the development of a 3d graphics renderer in C++ as part of a University project.
In this project, rendering through rasterisation and ray tracing is implemented. Camera motion and various display configurations exist within each sub-renderer.
Advanced lighting techniques are implemented to further the realisim of the environment. This work focuses on rendering the famous Cornell Box.
An example of the rendering is provided below:
